Medical Symptom Checker and Triage System

Problem: Build an AI system that takes patient symptoms and provides preliminary risk assessment and care recommendations.

Skills Demonstrated:

AI/ML: Implement decision tree or rule-based classifier using symptom combinations, severity scoring

Critical Thinking: Balance sensitivity vs specificity, understand when to recommend immediate care vs self-care

Problem Solving: Handle symptom ambiguity, multiple conditions, edge cases in medical logic

Modular Structure: Separate symptom input validation, risk assessment engine, recommendation logic, and output formatting

Clear Architecture: Flow from symptom collection → risk calculation → severity assessment → care recommendation

Deliverable: System that processes symptom inputs and outputs risk levels with appropriate care guidance.
